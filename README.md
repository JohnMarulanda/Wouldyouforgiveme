This React web app allows users to invite friends to a group apology. Friends can respond with "yes" or "no" to accept or decline the apology, and with each "no," the "yes" button grows larger. When "yes" is clicked, confetti celebrates the acceptance of the apology. Enjoy a fun and interactive way to say you're sorry!
